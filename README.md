## How to use

### Manual

Download a release, extract the mod you want into your own mod and add a the following dependency infos to your `modinfo.json`.

```json
"ModDependencies": [
  "shared-pools-and-definitions"
],
"LoadAfterIds": [
  "shared-pools-and-definitions"
]
```

### Automatic

Add a the following dependency infos to your `modinfo.json` and use the `F1`/right-click action `Build and Deploy Mod` of the [Anno Modding Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JakobHarder.anno-modding-tools) extension in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

```json
"ModDependencies": [
  "https://github.com/anno-mods/shared-resources/releases/download/v7.1/shared-pools-and-definitions.zip"
],
"LoadAfterIds": [
  "shared-pools-and-definitions"
]
```

## Contribution Guide

Shared mods in this repository may be used by many others. Strict rules are needed to not harm them:

- No modifications that change vanilla gameplay.
- Modifications that will be seen by all players (e.g. pools) have to include all translations.
- Size should be kept as small as possible. Shared mods will be repeated in every Mod that is using it.
- No modloader warnings.

If your shared mod follows different rules, is very big or only useful for a few then simply linking it in the above mods section may be the better choice.

### Create a release

Make sure to update the version in `modinfo.json`!

All you need to do is to create a tag with the version and a `v` in front (e.g. `v8.3`). A draft release will be created for you.

You can do that via browser:

- Go to `Releases` and click `Draft a new release`.
- Enter the new version (e.g. `v8.3` under `Choose a tag`).
- Check `Set as a pre-release` to avoid the release being immediately public
- Wait until GitHub creates the assets and adds them
- Publish the draft release created by GitHub

Or via console:

```
git tag v8.3
git push --tags
```
